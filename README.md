# Development of an AI-Based Energy Management System (FEMS) for Factory Power Saving

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the **AI-Based Energy Management System (FEMS)** project, developed to optimize and predict energy usage in factories.

## Project Overview

The main objective is to predict peak power consumption using advanced AI models, leveraging data collected from the Jeju Samdasoo factory through IoT-based big data collection systems.

## Dataset

Data used in this project was collected from [**Jeju Samdasoo factory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Samdasoo) using IoT sensing technologies, including both univariate and multivariate time-series datasets related to energy usage.
