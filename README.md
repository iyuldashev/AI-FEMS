# Development of an AI-Based Energy Management System (FEMS) for Factory Power Saving

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the **AI-Based Energy Management System (FEMS)** project, developed to optimize and predict energy usage in factories.

## Project Overview

The main objective is to predict peak power consumption using advanced AI models, leveraging data collected from the Jeju Samdasoo factory through IoT-based big data collection systems.

## Dataset

Data used in this project was collected from Jeju Samdasoo factory using IoT sensing technologies, including both univariate and multivariate time-series datasets related to energy usage.

## Methodology

Two key AI models were developed and evaluated:

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** for univariate data:
  - **R²:** 0.98
  - **RMSE:** 0.039
  - **MAE:** 0.026

- **eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** for multivariate data:
  - **R²:** 0.93
  - **RMSE:** 0.018
  - **MAE:** 0.013

## Benefits and Impacts

- Significant reduction in energy costs.
- Approximately 10–15% carbon emission reduction.
- Supports ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) compliance.
